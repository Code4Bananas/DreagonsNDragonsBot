Privacy Policy for DragonsNDragonsBot

Effective Date: September 15, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how DragonsNDragonsBot (“we”, “our”, or “us”) collects, uses, and protects your personal information when you use our Discord bot. By using DragonsNDragonsBot, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

1. Information We Collect

When you use DragonsNDragonsBot, we may collect certain information from you, including:

1.1. Discord User Information

Discord Username: Your username and user ID are used for authentication and interaction within Discord channels.

Server Information: The bot may access details of the servers it is added to, including the server ID and channel IDs, in order to perform its intended tasks (e.g., posting announcements or responding to commands).

1.2. Generated Content

Dragon Name and Image Data: The bot generates daily dragon names and images. This information is not stored by the bot but is used temporarily to send you a personalized message in the Discord channel.

1.3. OAuth2 Information

If you use the bot's OAuth2 feature to invite it to your server, we may request permission to access your Discord account for certain actions like reading messages, sending messages, or managing server roles.

We do not store your OAuth2 tokens; they are used solely for the purpose of completing your authentication process when adding the bot to your server.

1.4. Usage Data

Bot Interactions: Information about your interactions with the bot, such as commands issued, responses received, and the times those interactions occur, may be collected for logging purposes and to improve the bot’s functionality.

2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

Provide the bot's services: Including generating daily announcements, dragon names, and images for the Discord server.

Improve functionality: To enhance user experience, fix bugs, and optimize the bot’s features.

Communication: Notify users about important updates or issues related to the bot.

2.1. Data Retention

We retain only the necessary data to operate the bot and provide a smooth user experience. Data that is used for generating content (like dragon names and images) is discarded after the bot sends it to your server.

3. How We Protect Your Data

We use industry-standard security measures to protect the data we collect, including encryption and secure storage practices. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, so while we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

4. Sharing Your Data

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties, except in the following circumstances:

Service Providers: We may use third-party services (e.g., OpenAI) to generate content like dragon images or names. These services will only have access to the data required for those tasks.

Legal Requirements: We may disclose your data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or government agency).

5. Third-Party Services

DragonsNDragonsBot may use third-party services, such as OpenAI (for generating images) or Discord, to perform certain functions. These services may have their own privacy policies and terms of use, which you should review. We are not responsible for the practices of third-party services.

- OpenAI: We use OpenAI's API to generate images and names. For more information on how OpenAI handles data, please review their Privacy Policy
- Discord: For information on how Discord handles your data, please refer to Discord's Privacy Policy

6. Your Choices and Rights
6.1. Data Access and Deletion

You have the right to request access to your data and, in some cases, request its deletion. Since we do not store personal data outside of the bot’s operation, most data is ephemeral and is deleted after use. For any concerns or requests, please contact us directly.

6.2. Opting Out

If you no longer wish to use the bot, you can simply remove it from your Discord server. Once the bot is removed, it will stop collecting or processing any new data from that server.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Effective Date." We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.
